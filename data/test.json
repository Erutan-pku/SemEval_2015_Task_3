Sprinkler systems are heat-activated, not smoke sensitive. So don't worry about pushing a button on a white plastic box. It's not hard-wired into the emergency response system. It's just there to wake you up and get you out of the house in case of smoke.\nMandi",

If there is no source of lighting indication, then these might be battery operated, and so checking would be simple. If battery operated, first open the battery case cover, light a lighter/candle for a few seconds, and as soon as the buzzer goes on, remove one of the batteries. That should prove that the FAS works.\n\nIf it is building controlled, consult with the building owner first before taking any drastic steps..\n\nMaybe these helps...good luck with your inspection tomorrow!",

A good friend of mine has a Moroccan wife who has a PhD in English from one of their major universities and although her grammar and vocabulary was great, she couldn't really tutor because students wanted someone who had a native accent and 99 times out of a hundred, that will not be someone who studied English in a foreign university. \n\nSorry, but my wife was an English teacher for many years and still tutors, and I am still surprised at what passes for \"teaching\" in many cases.

So, keep on Salwa Road and you will cross Midmac round-about (now a flyover) Decoration round-about, Wholesale Market round-about, Aziziya round-about and another small round-about before coming to the new flyover which has replaced Industrial Area round-about. Go straight over the Industrial Area flyover, and keep to the right lane. About 500 mts after the flyover, and just before the next interchange, there is a road to the right, perpendicular to the main road. Take this right turn and on your right hand side is the new CEID department building where you can have your finger prints taken. I got it done for my family in less than 15 minutes.",

Yes, he was a leading force in the Enlightenment and he has had some influence on French thought, but Napoleon's influence upon the whole of Europe was far more profound. I suppose that you could compare Napoleon to Hitler, as in some ways Napoleon was responsible for a series of wars that affected the whole of Europe, from the gates of Moscow to Madrid. On the other hand, Napoleon was not a racist and certainly never even contemplated genocide. To be fair to Napoleon, it is true to say that the old monarchies of Europe were very unhappy with the appearance of republican France and therefore they set out to squash the Revolution by force of arms. So Napoleon did not start the wars that dragged on until 1815, but he certainly continued them, very successfuly for a long while, and his final defeat also meant the end of the Revolution and the return of the Bourbons.",

I *think* I've even seen small bottles at Carrefour. . .and ditto on the price.\n\nDon't worry too much about the Grade A vs Grade B.  The grocery stores tend to sell Grade A because consumers associate \"A\" with being superior to \"B\".  The Grade B does have a slightly nicer flavor, but Grade A will work just fine in your recipes.\n\nLike someone else mentioned, we bring ours in from the U.S. because it's much much less expensive. I think I brought at least three or four liters with me!\n\nEnjoy :o)",

Start from the first day. When you get your salary, ex. Qr10,000, set aside Qr2,000 in a saving account that you would open. Make sure you make it a standing monthly order, so your brain will function to accept that your salary is only Qr8,000 and you would have to manage with that. Maybe you would want to start small, but 20% of your monthly pay is a great start. Then you can increase it when you manage to settle into the saving/budgeting lifestyle. \n\nGood luck!",

If you were driving the car normailly and were not in an accident that was your fault, then the problem is theres.

They might back down (again speak to someone who knows if there are any ramifications for this!)\n\nIt may also be advantagous to have someone call on your behalf.

If you are an Arab with a westerner nationality, you are still called an arab with a westerner nationality.  That is true for Indians, Pakis,...etc.\nI think historically, the British expats who were here in the early days (70s, 80s) were a true representation of expats.  However, this has changed a lot through our the years.  I think the term \"expats\" now apply to a wider group of people.\nAnyway, all expats are welcome as they as they understand the culture.\nOne sad thing though, is the separation between expats and locals.  There is a boundary and low engagement.  That is why those terms will still have a meaning.  I am really looking for that day, when this term \"the way it means today\" disappears!\n",

If you modifed the Intake plate filter (K&N) then you have to modify your header (use S/S Mandrel bend headers) and an aftermarket exhaust chambered/free-flow muffler ( ex.Tanabe G-Medallion) plus a layer of thermal wrap to ever notice performance. If you can afford a Cold Air Intake that would be better, with all this modifications this would surely void your warranty.\n\nCheers,",

            "CBody": "It depends upon the mood of the person. I think it would be more appropriate to know from where this abaya came or its origin so that one can come to conclusion. Abaya, the black thobe, is not an Islamic order or must. The only cover Islam requires women to have is to wear something which covers the whole body from head to toe & the only thing should be visible is face, hands & feet. Second thing is the dress should not be revealing or body fitting, it should be something decent which should not give a hint about their figure nor it should be too loose which might attract others attention to make u a fun object. Third thing that should be taken care about is the dress should have modest colours & not shining & lots of art work which would attract opposite gender. \n\nNow coming to abaya, no where in Islam it is mentioned, neither is Quran nor in Ahadees (Sayings of Holy Prophet PBUH). Abaya is something cultural, sometimes ladies are made to wear these so that they are not identified by hiding their faces too with Nakaabs (face veils). Majority of men make their women use face veils because they are in a culture where people make fun of families for not following cultural values, sometiems out of enimity if a woman of a certain family is identifiable they kidnap her or try to harass her only to degrade any particular family. Sometimes, it is simply the choice of woman who feels comfortable in wearing abaya only because if she comes out in normal islamic dress, she'll have several stares from other women, forget about men at this stage. So instead of answering everyone why she is not following cultural values / dresses she prefers to make their mouth shut by being one of them. Sometimes its too humid outside & if the lady wants to follow her islamic dressing too she might wear something short inside & on it she can wear a loose abaya, thus giving her comfort + no sense of guilt. So there  are several possibilities that come with abaya thing. \n\nMy own thinking is that abaya is a full dress, its something like a man wearing shalwar kameez, or a woman wearing skirt shirt or an arabic man wearing white thobe so there is no need to wear additional dress to it. Briefs or vests are okay to make urself comfortable but wearing a skirt shirt then wearing a abaya for a corniche walk that goes beyond my mind. But yes, if you are working in a woman only environment & as humans like to show off what new dress or shoes do they have, they remove their abayas in there & move along with whatever decent they are wearing. \n\nLooks like I have written something boring so better to finish it off here :)\n\nCheers :)\n \n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n       CONFUSE ............ if you cannot convince!\n<a href=\"http://www.glitterfy.com/\"><img src=\"http://img34.glitterfy.com/342/glitterfy063341T565F.gif\" alt=\"Glitter Words\" border=0 /></a><br /><",

This book consists of 37 pages and it contains the following subjects:\nContents\nPronunciation of Arabic Alphabet\nPronouns - Professions\nLandmarks in the City\nIntroduction\nColors\nNumbers\nClock\nSports\nAt the Restaurant\nAt the Hospital\nAppendix \nWe tried in this book to mention the most common words and dialogs in Arabic.\nThe price of this book including delivery is 50 riyals (with out delivery 30 riyals).\nYou can get help from your Arabic friends at work to know how to pronounce the words\nFrom my experience, learning Arabic is not easy and if you want to learn (read + write) you need 2 years at least to do that, so most people prefer to study the spoken course and learn the most famous words in Arabic, and you get that from our book.\nhassanaboyaser/-a-t-/hotmail.com\nmobile: 5723567\n",

A lot of schools in Doha have little or no provision for SEN children and there is not much in the way of EAL support either. Trying to get the students through a curriculum that is in their second language is no easy task, so of course many schools would prefer to have more students for whom English is their \"mother tongue\". \n\nIf a school has a significant proportion of Qatari students, then of course the Supreme and Absolutely Perfect Education Council of Qatar will want to make sure that the little darlings are getting lots and lots of lessons in Arabic and Islamic Studies. (That's a fat lot of use if your family are not Muslims and and you speak English as your first language.) Learning Arabic may sound like a fun thing for your child to do, but it isn't because the Arabic teachers follow the Supreme and Immaculate Education Council's orders and therefore they teach it in a really dull and useless way, instead of concentrating on conversational Arabic that could be useful and enjoyable. As for Islamic Studies, the teachers (who are usually Egyptians or Lebanese) do not want to lose their jobs and so they let the students see the exam papers before the actual exams, so that they can memorise all of the answers. Then the students get amazingly high marks and everyone is happy.    ",

(These are usually the ones that do not have lots of Arabic and Islamic Studies on the curriculum.) Yes, a British passport does indeed come in handy, but so does a very big pile of cash. The better schools know that they are oversubscribed and so (surprise, surprise) they put up their fees accordingly.  \n\nI have no problem at all with the idea of expat children learning Arabic. I do, however, get very annoyed with the way that the Completely Wonderful Education Council insists that expat children should be taught Arabic in a way that is totally boring, lifeless and insipid. When I was teaching in Doha, several expat parents told me that they were happy for their children to learn Arabic, but they wanted them to learn conversational Arabic that the children could actually use. When I quizzed the teachers, they said that the Utterly Amazing Education Council laid down the law about how Arabic should be taught, so it is just another example of the Totally Magnificent Education Council screwing things up.\n\nGreat to hear from you again, Squarepeg.

If you have the money to pay the fees, or the company pays thats sufficient. \n\nThe exams are also for the 2010 start, which she will have sufficient time for climbing the waiting list. It isn't as cynical as you make it seem, and I may add that the Qatar canadian school is governered by the Ministry of Education and offers neither arabic nor Quran at this point, but do offer french as it is the second language of Canada. \n\n_____________________________________________________\n\"Diplomacy is the art of saying 'Nice doggie' until you can find a rock - Will Rogers\"",

Many parents are not in this happy situation, Amoud, and sometimes there is a BIG gap between what your company is prepared to pay and what the school expects you to pay.\n\nYour comment about \"climbing the waiting list\" assumes that you have in fact been given a place on the waiting list. If you bother to look back at previous postings on Qatar Living, you will find that plenty of parents have been told that the waiting list is full for the school of their choice, so how can they \"climb\" the waiting list?\n\nJust in case you have not noticed, Amoud, again and again on this forum there have been postings about which schools in Doha are the best. Compass, DESS, Park House and Doha College have frequently been mentioned by parents as being some of the best schools in Doha. Guess what? They are all British schools and a British passport, though not compulsory, is highly desirable if you want your child to go to one of these schools. The American School also has rave reviews and (surprise, surprise) the fees are probably the highest in Doha. Hence my comment about piles of cash coming in handy.   ",

As i walked in I was surprised to find that there were only two people in there. When I went there in June the place was balls to the wall with bodies. Anyhow, I politely went up to the females who sit and process the visas, the freindly lady sent me over to the opposite desk to the not so friendly official who is suppost to stamp your form and check your documents. Now when i walked in the building this guy was obviously on the dog big time however, when I came walking over he was suddenly overcome with work and far too busy to be arsed with the likes of some expat who's looking to bring more expats in the country. So he looks at me with distain that would topple a camel and tells me the form that I've just 2 hours ago downloaded from the net is no longer valid and they've changed the rules. Obviously i should have known this information, he was somehow bemused that my world didn't revolve around the ever changing Qatar visa system and the fact that i didn't know the changes that had been implemented only last week he could not comprehend. He then bamboozled me with some number and name of a travel agent of the name he said so fast it sounded and i actually wrote down Quarabatra travel, it was only later after i repeated this to the woman at the end of the qtel directory enquiries that i found out he was actually saying Cleopatra Travel?? This company were even less helpful than the visa official. bottom line, if you want a visa you'll have to get one through the hotels but there is always a loop hole and being a Brit we always find em.. The hotel will get you a 30 day visa so if like me you want your tourist to stay at your place just get the hotel for a night. also that way the hotel gets to clean your bed sheets after you haven't seen the mrs for 2 months, its going to get sweaty.\n\nCheapest hotel i found was the Intercontinental QR1000 +19% bulls**t charge",

Come when it's not so crowded. HAHA. A Gym that wants YOU to work to THEIR timings.\n\nOther than that, they have a lot of anti consumer policies, you cant cancel unless they take another month out of your credit card, they etll you you get a passport to use anywhere (but in reality you have to *apply* for it, and it's only for 30 days).\n\nJust drop by & see how they try to muscle you into taking the 1 year package no matter how much you tell them that you'll only be here for 6 months. Don't believe the transferable stuff because the responsibility is completely on you to find someone to transfer it to.\n\nAlso, parking in city center is hell. I could go on & on & on like how pretty much everyone there is paying a different rate for the exact same thing.\n\nI'd look for a good gym in a hotel.
