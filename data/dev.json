I teach judo at a school, and no, your child is too small for my club because five years old is the bare minimum to start judo; otherwise, the judo club becomes a day care. I would start with the Qatari Judo Federation. They seem to be pretty good with the kids. I haven't worked out with the adult players, because they are always training elsewhere. But the few times I've gone to visit them, there were kids working out. Tunisians are the instructors, and if your game to learn (or already know) French, I would enroll them in their program. They seem very qualified. It's an Arabic/French class at one of the local sports clubs around the Dafna area. Let me know, and I can try to get you contacted with the right people.",

A few weeks later, the car needed to come into service. The car had small scratch on front bumper. They make a big deal of it even though I am pretty sure it was there before I hired it. After service, they did not mention it and I took it out for another month. Next day they phoned me saying it would need to be charged at 450 QR! I tell them that they are taking the piss and ask to speak to the manager. A man phones later and insists I pay it claiming I need things like police reports etc - when I refuse he tells me to return the car. I say no problem if you give me back my money for the month I have hired the car. I suggest he comes into work and picks up the car. He does not come in and does not phone again.\n\nNext day, car has a problem and won't start (it has lots of little problems due to poor servicing). They come out with new key but take much longer than they said they would. The same guy finally turns up with another who looks threateningly at me and they go straight to the scratch. I tell them my feelings that it is minor but he makes a big deal about needing to get the whole bumper re-sprayed and that anybody doing the job for 100 QR (as I thought reasonable) would not do a good job. He says that as I am such a pal he will reduce it to 350 QR and that he will pay the remaining 100 QR. Basically, I have to agree to pay or there will be no new key.\n\nI take the car to the main dealers and they quote 100 QR!!!! I believe that it is not likely that the main dealers for this car model would be cheap or of a poor standard when it comes to spraying.\n\nI suggest you avoid Eurodollar as they are trying to squeeze money out of any opportunity... Even worse than the other car hire places I have tried.\n",

Some of the sugared cereals are up to 50% sugar (by weight - and more than that as a % of calories).  \n\nEven some of the yogurts have more grams of sugar per serving than a full-sized can of Coke, thanks to all the added sugar (and high fructose corn syrup).  Plain unsweetened/unflavored yogurt does contain natural sugar, as does fruit, but nowhere near the sugar levels of the typical \"fruit\" yogurt here in Qatar.\n\nNothing is ever truly perfect in the snack food world, but we can strive for \"the best we can find\". . .I just try to read the labels and use common sense :o)",

QTEL should not be bothered as they provide useless TV channels in Doha, unlike in Dubai PEHLA Network is facing losses due to customer switchover. \n\nIf it is illegal, then please talk with facts where in Qatar QTEL pulled out the dish antennas for Tata SKY.

            "CGOLD_YN": "Good", 
            "CBody": "This is one good article i found on net.\n\nIs Halal meat Halal?\n \n \nThe title of this article is a bit misleading. I do eat halal meat but only that which I have either slaughtered myself or from someone I know, trust and am confident can slaughter an animal properly. This may come across as a rather elitist viewpoint but it is only that - my viewpoint which I admit is more personal that strictly religious.\n \nIn my early years of Islam meat was just that, meat. I, like everyone else, simply looked for the halal logo on a packet of meat, the shop window or restaurant. I consumed a reasonable amount of meat per week. However things started to change. On one hand I started to realise that the phrase \"you are what you eat\" is literally true.  I noticed a huge difference in my health, outlook and religious state after periods of being vegetarian. On the other hand I started to question whether halal meat was actually halal. I wondered whether we could actually trust the butchers, the producers or even the slaughter man in the abattoir. I also questioned whether the intensive exploitation of animals rested comfortably with my understanding of Islam. I concluded that there was too much doubt involved and decided to follow the advice of the Prophet (peace be upon him and his noble family) to leave that over which I had doubt.\n \nAt one point my family had pretty much turned vegetarian. Meat rarely entered our house and the only time we ate meat was at friends' houses. Although vegetarianism is to be applauded and even encouraged, I do believe that some meat is healthy. All the Prophets ate meat with the grandfather of them all Ibrahim (peace be upon him) offering the sacrifice we still commemorate every year at the end of Hajj. \n\nUpon moving to the countryside our ambition to produce, slaughter and eat our own meat finally came true. We used to buy lambs from farmers, I would slaughter them and have someone butcher it ready for the freezer. We even started to breed our own chickens. The meat was fantastic; not only did it taste different but it looked and felt different. The texture and colour of real meat! \n\nOne of the benefits of living in the countryside is that you meet people that work in agriculture; these are the people that bring us our vegetables and meat. Through speaking to them I started to find out some things about both animal farming and supposed halal meat.\n \nAnimals are exploited. If one sees the conditions they are born, bred and die in it would horrify anyone with a good heart. Chickens lead miserable lives in huge sheds, sharing their space and air with thousands of others. They do nothing but feed and get fat as fast as possible ready to make their way to supermarkets selling them as \"Value\" meat or to a Chicken Cottage on the high street. Larger animals face similar problems. Lambs are pumped full of steroids to make sure they don't die, ewes with hormones so they give birth out of season and both feed on grass treated with insecticides. Cattle are sometimes born and bred in sheds; they never see daylight or eat a blade of grass.\n \nMuslims need to ask whether this is something they are truly happy eating. Is it good to eat meat that is full of rubbish, that led a miserable life and a stressful end? Is it not possible that all this transfers into the meat? One also needs to ask if this method of farming sits with the ethos and spirit of Islam. Does Islam not teach compassion, kindness and does it not fight exploitation? To me both these elements make most of the meat in the UK inedible. I do not want to subject my body to such produce and I definitely do not want to contribute towards an industry that exploits a community that praises Allah (Quran 13:15, 17:44 and 22:18).\n \nThrough an increasing interest in the whole area of meat, animal welfare and organic food I wanted to see whether local abattoirs would be open to me coming in and slaughtering animals. My talks and visits to some local abattoirs confirmed all my previous suspicions about halal meat in the UK. The first abattoir I ever called told me that there was no problem in coming and doing halal meat as they already had someone who did that. Upon questioning the abattoir it turned out that he man who did that was Muslim but did not slaughter them himself but processed them normally, meaning they were killed by non-Muslims. \"He reads a prayer on them or something then gives them to us,\" were the exact words. Another local abattoir informed me that \"all we do is halal meat\". Again after some probing I found out that none of the slaughter men were Muslim. The abattoir had actually entered into a deal with a Muslim who was processing them in this tucked away abattoir and selling the meat as halal. As you can imagine I was shocked. \n\nSo as you can see, there are some people out there that do not seem to have a conscience. They are pumping out thousands of carcasses of haram meat to butchers and restaurants and you are eating it. However, my problems with halal meat do not stop there. I also question the hygiene standards of a lot of Muslim owned abattoirs. The vet at my abattoir once said to me that he has seen places in Birmingham that were \"covered in shit\". \"How can you call that halal?\" he asked me. My other issue is with the slaughter men. As someone who visits an abattoir every week and does between 10-30 lambs I know your mind drifts. It makes me question whether those that work as slaughter men full -time really remember to say \"Bismillah - Allahu Akbar\" or even pay attention to what they are doing. This is not their fault but a consequence of the high demand for meat and the need to process so many animals per day.\n \nAs a result of all this thinking, research and experience I have made an oath not to eat halal meat ever again unless I know exactly where it has come from. I am not advocating that everyone does this as I appreciate this is not always possible, but to anyone who has taken the time to read this I would ask you to really question your relationship to meat. The Companions (may Allah be pleased with them) are known to have made themselves sick upon discovering that the source of some food was doubtful. \n\nA lot of my conclusions are purely personal. I wish modern day Sheikhs and scholars would address the issues of intensive farming, animal rights and what we eat. This whole area is sadly lacking and needs to be examined in order to give us some guidelines. At the end of the day those that simply want meat can put their trust in a logo. It is those that want something better, for themselves, their children and animals, that need to start thinking about the meat they eat and taking some tough decisions.\n\nby Muhammad Ridha Payne\n\nThanks.",

Reserve the property\n \nOnce you have chosen your ideal property, a reservation agreement is to be signed with the seller and a reservation deposit needs to be paid (will form part of the purchase price).\n \n2. Mortgage Pre-assessment\n \nEven most mortgage lender grant mortgage upon the completion of a project, if mortgage is crucial for buyer, we suggest buyer to communicate with banks and have a pre-assessment on how much buyer can borrow, prior to signing of property contract.\n \n3. Due Diligence\n \nPrior to signing of property contract, we suggest buyer to carry out a due diligence check on the developer and development on the following:\n the company registration certificate (if the seller is an entity) or proof of seller's identity (if the seller is a private individual) or proof of a personal who is duly authorised to sign all legal documents (if the seller is an entity or an attorney of the seller)\n the title certificate for the land\n the planning permission/consent\n the building licence\n all other relevant permissions for the commencement of the project\n any lien, debt, development finance, or encumbrances against the land and/or the project\n at least one of bank guarantee, insurance and/or assurance ensure the completion of the project or an escrow system to provide security for the buyer's property payments\n an independent quantity surveying (QS) system during the construction period\n \nThe above due diligence check is more appropriate to be done through a local law firm or conveyancing lawyer.\n \n4. Exchange Contract\n \nBefore singing preliminary purchase contract, buyers are suggested to consult a local law firm or conveyancing lawyer on analyse the risk, any unfavourable terms of the contract. Upon signing of the contract, first instalment/payment is often required.\n \n5. Ownership Certificate\n \nOnce the property is completed, the following procedures need to be completed in order for the seller to transfer the final title to the buyer:\n \na. Bring the title of the property to the archive office of the real estate registry\n b. Fill sale-purchase agreement that is available in the real estate registry\n c. The archive office registers the title information in the Archive database\n d. The seller takes the file from the archive office to the registrar office in the real estate registry\n e. The registrar office checks non-encumbrances\n f. The buyer pays the transfer fee at the real estate registry\n g. The notary office checks whether the seller is the owner before allowing the transfer to take place\n h. The director of the real estate registry office approves the transfer agreement\n i. The buyer takes the approved transaction to the registrar office for final records\n j. Buyer receives the final title in his name7\n",

From my previous experience, IBM T series laptops are the best one, then Dell Lattitude series.Never buy Dell inspiron series, my wife got one - very cheap made laptop. Finally if you have the budget go with the Macbook Pro - it generates less heat, battery life is also good and runs on BSD Unix on the background.
